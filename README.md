This repository contains the input files for MD simulations, their final frame coordinates, and analysis of the single mutant library selection data submitted to NCBI BioProject with accession number PRJNA1078904 which is used to generate related figures in  "Elucidating TolC Protein Dynamics: Structural Shifts Facilitate Efflux Mediated Î²-lactam Resistance" manuscript. 
/TolC-Mutagenesis-dist/src/40-fitness-stats-TolC-20230403-sigma2.5.ipynb notebook is used to process fitness stats of submitted TolC mutagenesis data.  
/TolC-Mutagenesis-dist/dump/20230403/ file contains all the outputs obtained from the 40-fitness-stats-TolC-20230403-sigma2.5.ipynb 
/TolC-Mutagenesis-dist/log/20230403/ file contains aligned sequencing reads and mutation counts.  

https://github.com/midstlab/PRS_and_Mode_analysis link contains scripts for PRS and principal components.
